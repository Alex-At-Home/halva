### Implicits

NOTE: If you are not familiar with Scala's Implicits you should review [Scala for Java Programmers](../../../../../../../../SCALA.md) first.

------------

Implicits are generated by the Halva Annotation Processor. You may need to 
[enable Java Annotation processing](../../../../../../../../IDEs.md) in your IDE/build tool).

------------

Halva supports Scala's Implicit injections, though with important differences. Implicit parameters are supported as well as implicit interfaces (for the ["PML" pattern](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=179766)). Recursive implicits (implicits that themselves require implicit parameters) are supported.

In Scala, implicits are injection at the *call site* - the Scala compiler statically analyzes the code and if an implicit is required, the current scope is checked for an available implicit. If one is available, the Scala compiler re-writes the call site to use the implicit value. Halva cannot support this without bytecode writing of some kind. As Halva is committed to using "plain old" Java a different method was chosen.

Halva uses context based implicits and generated implicit classes. A class that is to receive implicits is annotated with `@ImplicitClass`. Parameters can then me annotated with `@Implicit` to receive implicit injections at compile time. Your ImplicitClass can also implement `Implicitly<T>` to have an implicit interface applied. The Halva Annotation Processor generates an implementation that contains the implicit injections. Candidate injections come from classes annotated with `@ImplicitContext`.
