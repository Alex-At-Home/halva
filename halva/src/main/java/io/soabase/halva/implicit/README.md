NOTE: If you are not familiar with Scala's Implicits you should review [Scala for Java Programmers](../../../../../../../../SCALA.md) first.

Implicits are generated by the Halva Annotation Processor. You may need to 
[enable Java Annotation processing](../../../../../../../../IDEs.md) in your IDE/build tool).
