### Type Aliases

In Scala you can create true type aliases via the `Type` keyword. This is not possible in Java but we can get very close - close enough. In Halva, Type Aliases are generated by the Halva Annotation Processor. You declare an iterface that describes the type to be aliased and the Halva processor generates the class during normal javac compilation (you may need to enable Java Annotation processing in your IDE/build tool).

#### Declaring the Type to be Aliased

Halva can only alias interfaces. Aliasing concrete classes would most likely require byte code writing. But we can investigate it if there's a need for it. The general form for aliasing is:

```
@TypeAlias interface BaseNameForTheNewClass implements ClassToBeAliased{}
```

The annotated interface may not contain any content - no methods, fields, etc. Here's an example that aliases lists of pairs of string/ints:

```java
@TypeAlias interface PairList implements List<Pair<String, Integer>>{}
```

The generated class will be named `PairListAlias`. However, if you were to name the annotated source interface `PairListAlias_`, the generated class wouild be named `PairListAlias`. You can change these defaults with the TypeAlias attributes `suffix()` and `unsuffix()`.
